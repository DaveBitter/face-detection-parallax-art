# Native Browser Face Detection Parallax Art - Dave Bitter

[DEMO](https://face-detection-parallax-art.davebitter.com)

## What is it?

This application uses the experimental Face Detection API in the browser to bring artworks to live. It takes the position of the face and uses it to create a parallax effect to the top layer of the artwork.

## Why is it cool?

The experimental Face Detection API is part of the browser. There is no additional code shipped to make it work. This opens up a powerful toolset for developers to leverage and create concepts around in their applications.

## How can I run it?

- `yarn dev` starts a development environment with hot-module-reloading
- `yarn build` create a production-ready build
